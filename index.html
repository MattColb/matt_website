        <h3>SKILLS</h3>
        <p>I currently have most of my experience in Python. However, I have also learned how to use some front-end web development tools, such as CSS, HTML, and Javascript. I also have some experience in programming languages to help with data science, such as R and SAS. I also have some practical non-language skills, such as Git, Command Lines, Microsoft Office, and Google Drive.</p>

        <h1>PROJECTS</h1>
        <p>I am currently working on two main projects, with more planned in the future. I have one project that I have previously completed. All of my projects can be found on my <a class="paragraph_link" href="https://github.com/MattColb">GitHub.</a></p><br>
        <p>The first project is this website, which I will continue to improve as I have more projects, skills, and more sections to implement.</p><br>
        <p>I have previously worked on a <a class="paragraph_link" href="https://github.com/MattColb/password-gen">random password generator.</a></p><br>
        <p>The current project that has most of my focus is my <a href="https://github.com/MattColb/frc_average_app" class="paragraph_link">FIRST Robotics Competition average score app</a>. Average scores are what I used to determine a team's efficiency when I was a coach of an FRC team, and now that I am graduated, I wanted to build a tool to help my team. I am currently working to improve the efficiency, as well as make a front end for the app as I am learning Flask.</p><br>
        <p>I love to watch competitive tournaments of the game Super Smash Bros, and am currently in the brainstorming faze of building an app to follow tournaments, as well as make predictions based on previous tournaments. This will hopefully have a working version by the end of the year.</p><br>
        <p>I am also hoping to make an app for some aspect of the NBA or NCAA basketball, which should have the first version released around spring.</p>
